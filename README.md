Hats off to: 
 
 - Keith Packard, MIT X Consortuim 
 For developing the original xeyes that have been an inspiration to us all... 
 
 - Sarmad Adnan, adnan@rice.edu 
 For developing a Win16 set of eyes also called "wineyes" (but behaved differently than xeyes).
 
 - Robert W. Buccigrossi
 For WinEyes, which is a rewrite of xeyes utility for Win32, Pocket PC, ReactOS, and Wine.
